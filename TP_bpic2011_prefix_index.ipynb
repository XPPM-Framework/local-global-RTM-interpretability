an event log of complete cases of a business process, and a prefix case of the process as obtained from an event stream, we want to predict a performance measure of such prefix case in the future. For example, we may wsnt to predict the time of this case until completion (or remaining time) or its outcomeat completion. A **prediction point** is a point in the future where the performance measure has a predicted value. A prediction is thus based o nthe predictor's knowledge of the history of the process until the prediction point as well as knowledge of the future until the predicted point. The former is warrented by the predictor's **memory** while the latter is based on  the predictor's **forecast**, i.e., predicting the future based based on the trend nd seasonal patern analysis. Finally, the prediction is performed based on  a**prediction** algorithm.\n","Since in real-life business processes the amount of uncertainty increases over time, the prediction task becomes more difficult and genersally less acurate. As such, predictions are made up to a specific point of time in the future, i.e., the time zone **h**.
